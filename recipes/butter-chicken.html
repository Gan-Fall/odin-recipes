    <div class="recipe-box">
        <p><em>Butter Chicken</em> is a curry recipe very similar to
            <em>Chicken Tikka Masala</em> but instead of tomato paste, it uses a butter
            and spiced tomato gravy which the dish is cooked in.
        </p>

        <p>If you're not making the gravy yourself, it is a very easy and delicious
            recipe that is very creamy and tender. Can't go wrong with this one!</p>

    <h2 class="recipe-subheader">Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="recipe-box">

            <li>A stick of butter.</li>
            <li>Chicken meat.</li>
            <li>Your choice of rice or naan bread. Or both.</li>
            <li>Your favorite assortment of spices or vegetables that you might
                want to add. Get creative! Here are some suggestions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Carrots</li>
                    <li>Garlic</li>
                    <li>Rosemary</li>
                    <li>Parsley</li>

    <h2 class="recipe-subheader">Steps</h2>
    <div class="recipe-box">
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your chicken meat into small (around 1 inch) cube-like slices.</li>
            <li>Start heating up your frying pan in a medium-high fire.</li>
            <li>Cut a roughly 2 or 3 inch cube from the stick of butter and let it
                melt in the frying pan. Make sure to rotate the pan to make the
                butter melt evenly<br>throughout the frying pan. By the end you
                want to have a nice little puddle that will blend and simmer with
                the chicken and the sauce later.</li>
            <li>Once the temperature in the pan has picked up enough and the butter
                is sizzling, its time to drop in the chicken meat.</li>
            <li>Wait around 3 minutes while moving the meat around for the meat to
                seal and whiten all over.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is properly sealed, drop in the butter chicken sauce
                followed by the spices.</li>
            <li>Lower the fire to a low and place the lid on the frying pan</li>
            <li>After letting the meat simmer for about another 30 minutes, your
                chicken is ready. Serve it with your choice of side and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

    <h2 class="recipe-subheader">Tips</h2>
    <div class="recipe-box" id="bottom-text">
        <ul>
            <li>If you're using store bought sauce, you should have used about
                half the bottle. Leaving you with enough for another round. If you
                used up the second half, you can<br>rinse the bottle with water to get
                the last bits of sauce and drop it in as well into the pan. Don't use
                too much water so you don't get splashed.</li>
            <li>You can save a lot of money and be less wasteful by buying a whole
                chicken and cutting out the pieces of meat yourself, but if you don't
                feel comfortable wih<br>filleting the chicken yourself (or don't have time)
                , you can simply buy whole chicken breasts and cut them into cubes.</li>
        </ul>
